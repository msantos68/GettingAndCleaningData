###This README.md file is for Coursera Course Getting And Cleaning Data


##Course Project Description
The course project required us to download data from a Samsung smartphone where the information about the phone position was taken.



##Data Download
In order for the program to run you will have to download the data. This data was downloaded to the laptop/computer and unzipped.
 No changes to the unzipped folders should be made.



##Starting R
Start R Studio and set your working directory to the unzipped file location. This should be the subdirectry of UCI HAR Dataset where the following files are located:
•features.txt
•features_info.txt
•activity_labels.txt

Run the run_analysis.R script. Your tidy dataset called tidy_avg will be output along with the flat file Final_Tidy_Data.txt will be created in your working directory.
